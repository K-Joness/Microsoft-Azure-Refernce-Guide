# Microsoft-Azure-Refernce-Guide
A reference guide for common administration and configuration steps 

#In the bustling field of IT, you could be an administrator one day, and a cyber analyst the next. (I’m kidding.) What I mean to say, is that it is very easy to forget how a piece of gear, software, or even terminal commands if you haven't laid hands on it for a while. This was the case in my last position, where I was responsible for a wide range of IT gear and its configuration. Being the human that I am, focusing on one area of the job led to me becoming rusty in other areas. To solve this issue, I created a "Comm Bible", which contained the basic set of instructions for configuring different pieces of equipment. M It also had common issues and the solutions for them. Furthermore, it served as a notebook to record the discoveries I made when troubleshooting. This Microsoft Azure reference guide will serve the same purpose, only now it’s available to anyone who stumbles upon it.
